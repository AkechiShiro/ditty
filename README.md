Dirty pipe quick vulnerability checker

I've just improved the PoC made by Max Kellermann, that you can find at https://dirtypipe.cm4all.com/

You just need to `make` the binary (or download from releases) and run it to see if you're vulnerable.

You can also `make android` in order to compile the binary to check the PoC under Android, however you need to install Termux (on Google Apps or F-Droid) and install `clang` running `pkg install clang` in Termux.
